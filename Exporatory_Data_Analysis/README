# Exploratory Data Analysis

Here we will load, inspect, visualize, and clean our data for use.

#NOTE 

To enable the Colab notebook to work, you will first need to set up your own local API key from Kaggle:

To Generate Kaggle API Token:
1. Go to your Kaggle account settings.
2. Scroll down to the "API" section.
3. Click "Create New API Token." This will download a kaggle.json file containing your API credentials.

Once you have this, you're ready to follow along!
